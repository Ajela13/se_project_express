## Project Overview

WTWR is a back-end server project designed for the "What to Wear?" (WTWR) application. The goal of this project is to create a server that supports user authorization and an API for managing clothing items based on weather conditions. Users can securely interact with the app, managing clothing items by adding, deleting, and liking items, all while ensuring data integrity and security.

## Technologies and Techniques

- **Node.js**: For building the server-side application.
- **Express.js**: As the web framework for handling routing, middleware, and API endpoints.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: For data storage and ORM to manage collections of clothing items and user data.
- **Validation**: Data validation using Mongoose schemas and custom validation for inputs.
- **Testing**: Using tools like Postman to ensure code reliability.
